## Who does Jay admire?

1. [Jeff Booth](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffdbooth): CEO of [BuildDirect](https://www.builddirect.com/). Jay admires Jeff because of how Jeff poured blood, sweat and tears into building his company for nearly two decades. Jay mentioned Jeff made enormous sacrifices like mortgaging his house to keep his entrepreneurial dream alive. Jeff also had courage, at a time 10-12 years ago when it was rare to have someone with that level of ambition and risk seeking mentality. Jay describes Jeff as a bold contrarian!
