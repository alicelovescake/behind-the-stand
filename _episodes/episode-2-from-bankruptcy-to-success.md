As a first generation immigrant from Hong Kong, Melissa used her grit, perseverance and sheer drive to move up from her first job as a receptionist to selling her first company before the age of 35. 

At one point Melissa only had 90 days of runway and *hundreds of thousands of dollars* in crippling debt. But she didnâ€™t give up. She pushed through the most difficult parts of her life to get to build the freedom she has today.

Today, Melissa has a new venture [eWebinar](https://ewebinar.com/). eWebinar's mission is similar to her own, to enable people to live the life they want, by giving people back their time.

2. Read and re-read [The Alchemist](https://www.amazon.ca/Alchemist-10th-Anniversary-Paulo-Coelho/dp/0061122416): the ultimate journey of seeking your dreams.
3. Even if you are not in sales, it's important to understand how sales works: check out [The Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs](https://www.amazon.ca/Presentation-Secrets-Steve-Jobs-Insanely/dp/0071636080/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=The+Presentation+Secrets+of+Steve+Jobs&qid=1602459551&s=books&sr=1-1)
