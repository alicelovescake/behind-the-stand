As a child, Mariana used jewelry to hide deep, personal insecurities about her body.  Later in life, with only $500 in her pocket, she turned her insecurities into a fashion accessory business that enabled her to retire at 48 AND travel the world. 

Today, Mariana is a mentor in the [UBC CORE Entrepreneurship program](https://www.start.entrepreneurship.ubc.ca/).  Her mission in life is to inspire everyone to dare to live their life to the fullest!
